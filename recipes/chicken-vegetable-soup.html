<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Cook Chicken</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil or use a small 
        oven-safe pan. Make a bed for the chicken with a few sprigs of fresh herbs. 
        Rub the chicken with the teaspoon of olive oil then lightly season with salt 
        and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook until a thermometer pierced into the thickest part reads 165 degrees F, 
        25 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside until the chicken is cool 
        enough to touch. Remove the chicken from the skin and bones then chop into small 
        pieces.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Make Soup</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        About 10 minutes before the chicken is cooked, make the soup. Place a large 
        heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat (we use our Dutch oven). Add 1 1/2 tablespoons 
        of oil along with the onions, carrot, fennel and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring 
        occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften and look glossy, about 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in the garlic, herbs and bay leaf and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the stock, 
        turn up the heat and bring to a very low simmer. When the stock comes to a simmer, 
        you will likely need to turn the heat down to medium-low to keep it there. Stir in 
        a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a generous amount of pepper. Simmer for 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the zucchini, kale, pasta, and the chopped chicken. If you like, add some or 
        all of the cooking juices left at the bottom of the pan the chicken was roasted in. 
        Continue to cook at a low simmer for 10 minutes or until the pasta is al dente.
    </li>
    <li>
        Taste the soup and adjust with more salt — we usually end up adding 1 to 1 1/2 
        teaspoons total, but this will vary based on the stock you use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just before serving, drop the lemon slices into the soup. Serve with a little 
        grated parmesan cheese on top <em>(optional)</em>.
